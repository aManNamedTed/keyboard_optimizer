# keyboard_optimizer
keyboard optimization using frequency analysis and graph shortest path (maybe using tries?)

## Goals
* keylogger in python?
* frequency analyzer on that keylogger
* either put most pressed keys in close proximity
* or put most pressed shingled pairs in close proximity
* MAYBE i could just analyze frequencies of written articles for certain institutions.
* like if I took NY times articles and just counted letters, I could say these are the best personalized keyboards for your staff. or per person.
* because personality in speech seeps through when writing about anything regardless of subject i'd say.
